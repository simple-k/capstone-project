                <p>Studies have shown that inspirational early education has a great impact on future success. If a child embraces learning, independent thinking and leadership skills at a young age, they will be more likely to reach their full potential and be a contributing member of their community as an adult. These core values, instilled in pre-kindergarten, will follow them through to adulthood and produce contributing members of the community.</p>

                <p>San Antonio is one of just a few cities in the US that has successfully harnessed the impact of early childhood education. We are doing this by inspiring our pre-school children through engaging curriculum disguised as play. We’re doing this by mentoring educators on how to best engage our youth. We’re doing this by providing the resources to other San Antonio pre-school programs so that they can be part of this initiative.</p>
